    Steps Involved in Unlocking:
      1.  Verify that the device is configured to read/write from the CoreSight
          registers; this is done by reading the Identification Code Register
          and checking its validity.  This register is always at 0x0 on reads.
      2.  Check for errors in the status register.  If there are any errors,
          they must be cleared by writing to the Abort Register (this is always
          0x0 on writes).
      3.  Turn on the device power and debug power so that the target is
          powered by the J-Link as more power is required during an unlock.
      4.  Assert the ``RESET`` pin to force the target to hold in a reset-state
          as to avoid interrupts and other potentially breaking behaviour.
      5.  At this point, SWD is configured, so send a request to clear the
          errors, if any, that may currently be set.
      6.  Our next SWD request selects the MDM-AP register so that we can start
          sending unlock instructions.  ``SELECT[31:24] = 0x01`` selects it.
      7.  Poll the MDM-AP Status Register (AP[1] bank 0, register 0) until the
          flash ready bit is set to indicate we can flash.
      8.  Write to the MDM-AP Control Register (AP[1] bank 0, register 1) to
          request a flash mass erase.
      9.  Poll the system until the flash mass erase bit is acknowledged in the
          MDM-AP Status Register.
      10. Poll the control register until it clears it's mass erase bit to
          indicate that it finished mass erasing, and therefore the system is
          now unsecure.

    Args:
      jlink (JLink): the connected J-Link

    Returns:
      ``True`` if the device was unlocked successfully, otherwise ``False``.

    Raises:
      KinetisException: when the device cannot be unlocked or fails to unlock.
